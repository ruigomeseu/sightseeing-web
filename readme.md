# Sightseeing.io

This is the backend and API for the Sightseeing.io project, developed during a 7-day hackaton [Porto Summer of Code](http://www.portosummerofcode.com/) (PSC)

# Hackathon Place

16 teams participated on PSC and we got the first prize with this platform, being awarded an iPad Air for each of the members of the team.

# Features

This is a Laravel application that doubles as an API and a backend platform.

## API

A REST API with a few endpoints that provides data to the Android application built in the hackathon as well.

It also serves as a bridge between the ElasticSearch server that powers the Suggestions Engine on the Android application.

## Backend

Allows for editing of all the city sights, uploading images to Amazon S3 and editing the iBeacons information.

Has a powerful Analytics section that gathers information from the Android app and shows outstanding charts and statistics.
